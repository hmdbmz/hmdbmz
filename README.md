### Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

As a teenager at school, I was the kid other students approached about issues with their phone or laptop. I was the go-to guy for fixing resolving any technical problems.

Today, not much has changed. Iâ€™m still the first point of call for technical issues. The difference is I now also develop innovative software to solve problems. One of my most recent projects involved designing and rolling-out a new piece of software to track covid-19 cases.
